# UFOs

Module 11: UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview of the project

In this week, the student helped Dana, a data journalist, to write a HTML page focused on UFOs. Dana wants to put several items in the same page; an image header with a title, an article, a table with information about UFOs that were seen and easy to use filters for the table.

The table shows the date, city, state, country, UFO shape, duration and comments. The user should be able to use the dynamic table and select one or more filters (except for the duration or comments) to narrow down the data on the table. This can be extremely helpful to provide insights on specific cities, dates, forms etc. of the UFOs seen in the sky. 

## Results

#### HTML page

As shown above, the HTML page has a navigation bar on top, followed by a header with an image and title and an article right below it. The interactive part of the website is the filters on the left and the table at the bottom.

The user can search for specific data of the UFOs seen by applying the filters by date, city, state, country of UFO shape; there is a sample of the type of data that to be typed in for each one of the filter boxes. The person can use only one filter or a combination of the filters to select the data. In the example below, the user filters the search only by the triangle shape:

But now, let us assume that the user would like to see the data of UFOs that have a triangle shape and were spotted in California. By typing in triangle in the shape filter and ‘ca’ in the state filter, the user will see the table filtered by those two criteria:

The user can also apply all filters available. In the example below, the two results shown based on the criteria below: 
* date = 1/1/2010 
* city = el cajon
* state = ca
* country = us 
* shape = triangle

## Summary

In summary, based on the specific analysis of temperature for June and December, it seems that the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round, the temperature average temperature difference between summer and winter is only 4 F. 

An additional analysis to be performed is related to the precipitation. The temperatures are only one factor that is relevant to the shop, if there’s too much rain in the location, that can also impact sales. To perform the query, user can replace the ‘Measurement.tobs’ to ‘Measurement.prcp’. Below is the example for the June analysis:
